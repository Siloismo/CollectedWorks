# Silo's Archive

these are the Markdown versions of Silo's Works, as found in original website [http://silo.net/](http://silo.net/)

we just corrected some double space.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown text format is easy to edit and to convert into ANY other format (PDF, rtf, html, doc)

Read [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) if you don't know about it

## Why on GitHub?
We are planning to convert ALL Silo's books into Markdown format.
Using GitHub we can allow others to help and keep track of all changes.

## Collaboration
this project is maintained at [https://github.com/Siloist/SiloArchive](https://github.com/siloist/SiloArchive) by Stefano Cecere <https://github.com/stefanocecere/>
